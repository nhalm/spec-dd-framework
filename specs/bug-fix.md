# Bug Fix Punch List

Living punch list for cross-cutting code bugs, wiring omissions, and small
fixes that don't warrant a spec version bump. Items are grouped by owning spec.

Loop agents: when implementing a spec, check this file for items under that
spec's heading. Fix one per iteration. Delete the item from this file after
fixing and committing.

Items marked `(blocked: ...)` can't be fixed until their dependency resolves —
same convention as tracks.md.

---

<!-- Add spec headings as specs reach "Ready" status. Example:

## example-spec.md

- Description of the bug or fix needed
- Another bug (blocked: other-spec.md)

-->
