<!--
  CHANGELOG RULES:
  - Add a new entry for each version bump
  - Old entries are immutable — never edit them
  - Summarize what changed so agents can catch up quickly
  - Example of a later entry:

  ### v0.2 (2026-01-15)
  - Added authentication flow (Section 3)
  - Changed database schema: users table now has `email` column
  - Removed: password reset via SMS (moved to future phase)

## Overview

<!--
  The Overview should answer:
  - What does this component do? (1-2 sentences)
  - Why does it exist? What problem does it solve?
  - What is its scope? (what it does AND what it doesn't do)
-->

One-paragraph description of what this feature/component does and why it exists.

**Scope:**
- Thing it handles
- Another thing it handles

**Out of scope:**
- Thing explicitly deferred to another spec or future phase

**Dependencies:**
- other-spec.md — what we need from it

**Design principles:**
- Key constraint or trade-off that shaped the design

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section is the meat. It should be detailed enough that
  an agent can implement it without asking questions, but NOT prescribe
  specific code structure. Focus on behavior, contracts, and interfaces.

  Common subsections (use what's relevant):
  - Architecture (ASCII diagrams welcome)
  - API endpoints (request/response formats)
  - Database schema
  - Configuration (env vars, files)
  - Error handling (error codes, messages)
  - Health checks
  - Security considerations

  DRAFT stage: This section can be empty or just say "_To be written_"
  READY stage: Must be complete enough for implementation
-->

_To be written_

## Notes

<!--
  Optional section for:
  - Design decisions and rationale
  - Things you considered but rejected
  - Open questions (resolve before moving to Ready)
  - References to external docs, RFCs, libraries
-->

## References

<!--
  Links to relevant external resources, related specs, or design docs.
