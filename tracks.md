# {PROJECT_NAME} Implementation Tracking

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE:

1. Section header = "## spec-name.md vX.Y" - must match current spec version
2. If spec version > section version: check spec changelog and spec, add new items to Remaining, update header
3. If no section exists: compare spec to code, create section with Implemented and Remaining lists
4. Pick ONE item from Remaining (skip blocked items)
5. Implement it, verify with tests
6. Move item from Remaining to Implemented
7. SPEC IS SOURCE OF TRUTH - if code contradicts spec, that's a Remaining item to fix (see AGENTS.md)
8. Check spec Changelog for changes that invalidate existing code
9. When adding new sections add to the TOP of the tracking section if new spec version.
