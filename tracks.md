# {PROJECT_NAME} Implementation Tracking

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE:

1. Section header = "## spec-name.md vX.Y" - must match current spec version
2. If a spec version > section version and the section still has remaining items, complete the remaining items.
3. If spec version > section version: check spec changelog and spec, add new items to Remaining, update header
4. If no section exists: compare spec to code, create section with Implemented and Remaining list above all other sections and below these instructions.
5. Pick ONE item from Remaining (skip blocked items)
6. Implement it, verify with tests
7. Move item from Remaining to Implemented
8. After moving an item to Implemented, search ALL Remaining sections for "(blocked: ...)" annotations that reference the work you just completed. Remove resolved blockers. If an item has multiple blockers and only some are resolved, remove the resolved ones and keep the rest.
9. SPEC IS SOURCE OF TRUTH - if code contradicts spec, that's a Remaining item to fix (see AGENTS.md)
10. Check spec Changelog for changes that invalidate existing code
11. When adding new sections add to the TOP of the tracking section if new spec version.
12. If your assigned spec has no Remaining items, scan ALL other sections for Remaining items and pick one to implement. Work is not done until every section has Remaining: (none).

## example-spec.md v0.1

**Status:** In Progress

**Implemented:**
- (nothing yet)

**Remaining:**
- Item one from the spec
- Item two from the spec
- Item three (blocked: other-spec.md)
- Item four (future)
